# Update User Persona

You are helping the user update `/Users/manu/Documents/GitHub/Feature_Building/context_knowledge/User_persona.md`.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Read Current Persona

```
/Users/manu/Documents/GitHub/Feature_Building/context_knowledge/User_persona.md
```

Present a brief summary:
- Name, demographics, key metrics
- Top motivations

- Core goals

### Step 2: Ask What to Update

Ask the user: "What would you like to update in the persona?"

**Common updates:**
1. **Demographics** - Age, occupation, household, health metrics
2. **Background story** - New research insights about user journey
3. **Motivations** - Changed understanding of what drives users
4. **Frustrations** - New pain points discovered
5. **Goals** - Refined user goals from research
6. **Pain points** - Updated daily challenges
7. **Needs from solution** - What users actually want
8. **Full rewrite** - Create a new persona based on new research

### Step 3: Make the Changes

Based on user input:
- Use Edit tool for targeted section updates
- Use Write tool for full rewrites
- Preserve the markdown structure (bold headers, bullet lists)

Remind the user: "This persona is referenced by agents to ensure features are designed for real user needs. Changes here affect how agents frame problems and solutions."
