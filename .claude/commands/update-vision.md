# Update Product Vision

You are helping the user update `context_knowledge/Vision_Balance.md`.

## Your Task

### Step 1: Read Current Vision

Read the current vision file:

```
context_knowledge/Vision_Balance.md
```

Present a brief summary of the current content to the user:
- Current problem statement
- Core pillars
- Vision statement
- Key differentiators

### Step 2: Ask What to Update

Ask the user: "What would you like to update in the vision document?"

**Common updates:**
1. **Problem statement** - Market has changed, new insights
2. **Core pillars** - Adding, removing, or redefining pillars
3. **Vision statement** - Strategic direction shift
4. **Market positioning** - New competitive landscape
5. **Delivery model** - How the product works has evolved
6. **Full rewrite** - Start fresh with new vision

### Step 3: Make the Changes

Based on user input:
- If updating specific sections, use the Edit tool to modify only those sections
- If full rewrite, use the Write tool with the complete new content
- Preserve the overall markdown structure (headings, sections)

### Step 4: Validate

After saving, read the file back and show the user:
- What changed (before → after for modified sections)
- Confirm the file is saved

Remind the user: "This file is used by prdDiscoveryAgent and other agents to understand your product's strategic direction. Changes here will influence future PRDs and feature specs."
