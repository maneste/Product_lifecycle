## Tier 4: Exploratory Hypotheses - Needs Further Validation

### 11. Multi-Channel Delivery Increases Reach

**Source:** Pre-Consultation Engagement Chat PRD (Assumptions to Validate)

**Assumption:** Multi-channel delivery (email + WhatsApp + in-app) is necessary to maximize reach.

**Rationale:** Users prefer different channels; redundancy increases engagement likelihood.

**Evidence Strength:** LOW (assumption, not validated)
- No data on Balance users' channel preferences yet
- Industry: WhatsApp has high engagement in Spanish market
- Needs direct user research

**Business Impact:**
- Potentially higher engagement rates
- But: increased complexity and cost
- ROI depends on incremental reach

**User Impact:**
- Meet users where they are
- Flexibility and convenience
- But: may feel like spam if not managed well

**Validation Needed:**
- Survey 50-100 users on channel preferences
- A/B test single-channel vs. multi-channel
- Track engagement by channel

**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐
- Tactical delivery optimization
- Not core to hypothesis validation
- Can start with single channel (MVP)

### 12. Progress Bar Creates Motivation

**Source:** Pre-Consultation Engagement Chat PRD (Assumptions to Validate)

**Assumption:** Progress bar ("20% of your plan is ready") creates motivation through gamification.

**Rationale:** Visual progress indicators drive action and create anticipation.

**Evidence Strength:** LOW (assumption, not validated)
- Gamification principles suggest effectiveness
- But: may feel manipulative if not authentic
- Needs user testing on perception

**Business Impact:**

- Potential uplift in engagement
- Risk: negative perception if feels gimmicky

**User Impact:**
- Sense of momentum and progress
- Anticipation building
- But: could create pressure or anxiety

**Validation Needed:**
- A/B test with/without progress bar
- Qualitative testing: does it feel motivating or manipulative?
- Measure impact on consultation scheduling rate

**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐

- Revisit based on user feedback

---

### 13. Peer Benchmarking Motivates (vs. Demotivates)

**Source:** Pre-Consultation Engagement Report PRD (Assumptions to Validate)

**Assumption:** Seeing "patients like you" creates belonging and realistic expectations (vs. triggering anxiety through comparison).

**Rationale:** Social proof reduces isolation and provides realistic benchmarks.

**Evidence Strength:** LOW-MEDIUM (mixed evidence)
- User quotes show comparison happens naturally (social media)
- "Veo gente en redes perdiendo 30 kg en 4 meses y me comparo"
- But: comparison can be demotivating if expectations are unrealistic
- Needs careful framing

**Business Impact:**
- Could increase engagement and motivation
- But: risk of triggering negative comparison
- Depends on execution

**User Impact:**
- Positive: belonging, realistic expectations, hope
- Negative: anxiety, inadequacy, pressure
- Outcome depends on framing and context

**Validation Needed:**
- A/B test personalized messaging WITH vs. WITHOUT peer comparison
- Qualitative feedback on emotional response
- Measure impact on consultation attendance and subscription conversion

**Strategic Importance:** ⭐⭐
- Content design decision, not core feature

- But: no specific data on optimal report length

**Validation Needed:**
- Track scroll depth and time on page
- Test 1-minute vs. 3-minute vs. 5-minute versions
- Measure bounce rate and engagement quality

**Strategic Importance:** ⭐

**Assumption:** "Warm, affirming, encouraging" tone builds trust without feeling overly promotional.

**Rationale:** Balance differentiates on "clinical trust + human warmth."

**Evidence Strength:** MEDIUM
- User quotes favor personalized, empathetic communication
- "Prefiero el enfoque personalizado y el 'feedback' interactivo"
- But: optimal tone balance needs testing

**Validation Needed:**

## Notes on Other PRDs

### PRDs Without Formal Hypotheses:

**1. Balance B2B Strategy PRD:**
- Critical analysis document, not a feature PRD
- Contains market hypotheses but focused on external strategy
- Not included in this consolidation (different document type)

**2. MainEvents & Tasks PRD:**
- Feature specification with objectives, not hypothesis-driven
- Success metrics defined, but not framed as testable hypotheses
- Consider reformulating objectives as hypotheses for better testing

**3. Online Forum Awareness Strategy PRD:**
- Idea-stage PRD without formal hypothesis structure
- Could benefit from hypothesis formulation:
  - Potential H: "Balance's expert presence in forums will reduce CAC by 30% within 6 months"
  - Potential H: "Forum engagement will generate 20% of new leads"

**Recommendation:** Standardize PRD format to include explicit Hypotheses section for all future feature PRDs.
