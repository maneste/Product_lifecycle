## Usage Guidelines

**When to use this framework:**
- Brainstorming sessions
- Idea validation before creating a full PRD
- Quick concept pitches to stakeholders
- Early-stage feature exploration

**This is NOT a replacement for:**
- Full PRD (Product Requirements Document)
- Technical specifications
- Implementation plans

**Next steps after idea drafting:**
- If idea validates well ’ Create full PRD using prdDiscoveryAgent
- If idea needs more research ’ Gather user evidence
- If idea is unclear ’ Refine problem statement and solution
