• Gender: Female 

• Occupation: Administrative Assistant

• BMI: 32 

• Health Status: Struggling with obesity, prediabetes 

• Income Level: Middle-income 

Background: 

Maria has been overweight for most of her adult life, especially after her pregnancies. She’s tried multiple diets and workout programs but has struggled to maintain long-term success.  

In the past, she’s experienced short-term weight loss but always regained the weight, leading to frustration and feelings of defeat. She feels self-conscious discussing her weight with family or friends, especially in social settings where food is involved. 

Now, she is highly motivated to  

Motivations: 

• Health Concerns: Maria’s doctor has warned her about prediabetes and the risk of heart disease if she doesn’t make lifestyle changes. 

• Energy and Vitality: She wants to have more energy to play with her children and be more active in her daily life. 

• Self-Esteem: Maria desires to feel better about herself, improve her body image, and regain confidence. 

• Long-Term Change: While she’s interested in achieving quick results, Maria knows that sustained, long-term change is essential for her health. 

• Medication Support: She is open to trying medication, such as GLP1 medications, if it can help her reach her goals with fewer frustrations. 

Frustrations: 

• Behavioral Challenges: 

Maria struggles with consistency in behavior change. Emotional eating is a significant challenge, especially when she feels stressed or anxious. She finds it hard to break old habits, and she often lacks willpower, especially when surrounded by unhealthy food at family gatherings or at work. 

• Medical and Treatment Barriers: 

Maria has had negative experiences with past treatments, which makes her skeptical of new weight-loss programs. She is concerned about potential side effects from medications and doesn’t fully understand how to integrate exercise, diet, and medication effectively. The cost of treatments and medication is another concern, as she is already managing her family’s finances. 

• Long-Term Maintenance: 

Maintaining any weight loss has always been a major issue. Maria is afraid of regaining the weight once she reaches her goals, and she doesn’t feel like she has a support system to help her maintain new habits. She’s tired of feeling like she’s constantly on a “diet” and wants something that fits into her busy life as a mother and full-time worker. 

Goals: 

• Lose weight sustainably to prevent further health complications (e.g., diabetes). 

• Develop better habits around food and exercise that last long-term. 

• Understand and trust medical interventions (e.g., GLP1) as part of her weight loss journey. 

• Find a community or professional guidance that offers support, accountability, and motivation. 

• Incorporate convenient, healthy meal options and realistic exercise routines into her busy life. 

Pain Points: 

• Lack of time to commit to complex diet plans or long exercise routines. 

• Emotional eating triggered by stress and negative emotions. 

• Skepticism toward new medications or treatments due to prior failures. 

• High cost of comprehensive weight-loss programs and medication. 

• The availability of unhealthy food in her environment makes it harder to stay on track. 

What She Needs from a Solution: 

• A personalized approach to weight loss that factors in her emotional and psychological relationship with food. 

• Affordable and transparent pricing for treatments and medication. 

• A support system with access to nutritionists, exercise plans, and mental health professionals. 

• Tools to help her stay motivated long-term, such as tracking progress and receiving feedback from professionals. 

• Options for convenient, pre-prepared healthy meals to reduce the time and effort needed to make healthy choices.
