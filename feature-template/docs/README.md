# Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the feature.

## Files

### context.md
**Purpose**: Define the problem, users, goals, and constraints for this feature.

**When to use**: Fill this out BEFORE running the agent pipeline. This is your input to the agents.

**Contains**:
- Problem statement
- Target users
- Business goals and success metrics
- Constraints (timeline, budget, technical)
- Assumptions and open questions

### prd.md
**Purpose**: Product Requirements Document generated by the PRD agent.

**When created**: Automatically generated when you run `npm run agent:prd`

**Contains**:
- Product overview and vision
- Features with user stories and acceptance criteria
- Success metrics
- Timeline

### user-flows.md
**Purpose**: User flows and journey maps (optional, generated from design specs).

**When created**: Can be generated after running the Product Designer agent.

### design-system.md
**Purpose**: Design system documentation (optional).

### architecture.md
**Purpose**: Technical architecture documentation (optional).

## Workflow

1. **Start here**: Fill out `context.md`
2. **Run agents**: Execute agent pipeline
3. **Review outputs**: Check agent-generated docs
4. **Refine**: Update context and re-run if needed
5. **Build**: Use docs as reference during implementation

## Agent Outputs

Agent outputs are saved as JSON in `../data/processed/`:
- `user-research.json`
- `prd.json`
- `design-specs.json`
- `tech-architecture.json`

You can generate markdown docs from these JSON files for easier reading.

## Best Practices

1. **Version control**: Commit docs to git
2. **Keep updated**: Update docs as feature evolves
3. **Reference in code**: Link to relevant doc sections from code comments
4. **Review regularly**: Revisit context and requirements periodically
